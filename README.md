# Car Sales Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of car sales data, exploring various factors influencing car purchases and trends in the automotive market. The dataset used for this analysis can be found here: [Kaggle - Car Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/missionjee/car-sales-report).

## Key aspects of this project include:

* Analyzing the average price of cars sold over two years.
* Investigating the impact of factors such as car model, engine type, and transmission on sales and pricing.
* Exploring regional variations in car sales across different dealerships.
* Removing outliers and cleaning the dataset to ensure accurate analysis.
